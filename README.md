Simple hangman game implemented using python programming language
This is a simple Hangman game using Python programming language. We can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it. Hangman is a popular word game in which one player (the "chooser") chooses a secret word and another player (the "guesser") attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. If a guessed letter appears in the word, all instances of it are revealed. If not, the guesser loses a chance. If the guesser figures out the secret word before he or she runs out of chances, he or she wins. If not, the player who chose the word wins.
